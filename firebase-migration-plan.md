## Firebase Migration Architecture

### Core Firebase Services

#### 1. Firebase Hosting
**Replace**: Current Vercel deployment  
**Benefits**: Global CDN, SSL certificates, custom domains, better integration  
**Migration**: Simple `firebase deploy` replaces current CI/CD  

#### 2. Firebase Authentication
**Replace**: Auth0 implementation in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`  
**Benefits**: Native Google ecosystem integration, no monthly fees up to 50K users  
**Features**: Email/password, Google, Apple sign-in, JWT management  

#### 3. Cloud Firestore
**Replace**: Supabase PostgreSQL in `src/config/supabase.ts`  
**Benefits**: Real-time subscriptions, offline capability, automatic scaling  
**Schema Design**:
```typescript
// Users Collection
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
  name?: string
  picture?: string
  organizationId?: string // For team management
  role: 'user' | 'admin' | 'owner'
  subscription?: {
    stripeId: string
    status: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'past_due'
    plan: 'monthly' | 'annual' | 'enterprise'
    currentPeriodEnd: Timestamp
  }
  createdAt: Timestamp
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}

// Organizations Collection (Enterprise)
interface Organization {
  id: string

  plan: 'team' | 'enterprise'
  memberCount: number
  apiAccess: boolean
  customBranding?: {
    logo: string
    primaryColor: string
    name: string
  }
}
```

#### 4. Firebase Functions
**Replace**: Custom API endpoints  
**Endpoints**:

**Features**: Conversion tracking, user journey analysis, revenue attribution  

#### 6. Cloud Logging
**Replace**: Custom monitoring endpoints  
**Benefits**: Structured logging, error reporting, alerting integration  

### Gemini AI Integration

#### Vertex AI + Gemini Pro
**Replace**: OpenAI/Ollama system in `src/utils/article.ts`  
**Benefits**:
- 60% cost reduction vs OpenAI GPT-4
- Managed service within Google Cloud
- Enhanced safety filters
- Better prompt engineering capabilities

export const generateAnalysis = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const vertexAI = new VertexAI({
    project: 'your-project-id',
    location: 'us-central1'
  })
  
  const model = vertexAI.preview.getGenerativeModel({
    model: 'gemini-pro'
  })
  
  // Enhanced prompts with better context
  const result = await model.generateContent({
    contents: [{ role: 'user', parts: [{ text: enhancedPrompt }] }]
  })
  
  return result.response.text()
})
```

## Subscription Architecture Enhancement

### Current Stripe Implementation

    amount: 999, // $9.99
    interval: 'month',
    features: ['AI Analysis', 'Basic Indicators', 'Email Support']
  },
  ANNUAL: {
    priceId: 'price_annual_9999', 
    amount: 9999, // $99.99 (save $20)
    interval: 'year',
    features: ['All Monthly Features', 'Priority Support', 'Advanced Alerts']
  },
  ENTERPRISE: {
    priceId: 'price_enterprise_custom',
    amount: 'custom', // $299-999/month
    features: ['Team Management', 'API Access', 'White Label', 'Custom Integration']
  }
}
```

### Webhook Enhancement
```typescript
// firebase/functions/src/stripe-webhooks.ts
export const stripeWebhook = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature']
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, sig, process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
  
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'customer.subscription.created':
    case 'customer.subscription.updated':
      await updateFirestoreSubscription(event.data.object)
      await sendWelcomeEmail(event.data.object.customer)
      await trackAnalyticsEvent('subscription_created', event.data.object)
      break
    // Handle other events...
