# Phase 3: LLM-Enhanced Summaries

## Overview

Incorporate an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to make summaries more readable and natural, rephrasing templated text into engaging prose.

## Goals

- Improve user experience with human-like narratives.
- Optional enhancement for premium feel.

## Requirements

- Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 API for article generation with custom prompts.
- Fallback to phase 1 templates if API fails; validate output quality.
- User toggle for "enhanced mode."
- Cache LLM responses to reduce costs.
- Secure API keys via environment variables; handle rate limiting.

## Tasks

1. Set up OpenAI SDK and prompt templates.
2. Modify article logic to use LLM with fallbacks.
3. Add toggle, error handling, and output validation.
4. Test with mocked responses and quality checks.

## Dependencies

- OpenAI SDK.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Enhanced articles feel more readable and accurate.
- Toggle works; fallbacks and caching function.
