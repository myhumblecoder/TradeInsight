# Phase 4: Monetization and Deployment

## Overview

Deploy to cloud, add managed login, paywall for features, and Stripe subscriptions.

## Goals

- Monetize the app sustainably.
- Secure and scale for users.

## Requirements

- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify/AWS with CI/CD.
- Implement auth (e.g., Auth0) with login/signup and user data storage (e.g., Supabase).
- Gate features (e.g., full articles for paid users).
- Integrate Stripe for subscriptions (e.g., $9.99/month) with webhooks.
- Add monitoring (e.g., Vercel Analytics, CloudWatch) for metrics like user engagement and errors.
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance and payment security.
- Include staging environments and rollback plans.

## Tasks

1. Set up deployment pipeline and database (e.g., Supabase).
2. Add auth components, guards, and paywall logic.
3. Integrate Stripe checkout, webhooks, and compliance checks.
4. Enable monitoring, tie to Pino logs, and add alerts.
5. Test end-to-end flow, including A/B for paywall.

## Dependencies

- Auth provider (e.g., Auth0), Stripe SDK, cloud monitoring tools, database.

## Acceptance Criteria

- App deployed with login, paywall, and subscriptions.
- Payments process securely; monitoring tracks metrics.
- Compliant with privacy standards.
